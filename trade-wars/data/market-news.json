Additionally, there is notable institutional activity, with firms like Sora Ventures and others planning significant Bitcoin purchases, which could support upward price moves.\n\nA critical event to watch is the potential for a market reaction to macroeconomic data and the ongoing debate around Bitcoin's role as a hedge amid global economic uncertainty. Technical levels near $110,000 to $112,000 are being tested now, with a possible breakout or pullback depending on the data and flows.\n\nThe market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic but sensitive to macroeconomic surprises. The current outlook is neutral to slightly bullish, with active traders watching for confirmation of a breakout above resistance or a bounce at support levels.",
