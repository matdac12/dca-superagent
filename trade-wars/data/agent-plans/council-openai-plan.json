  "plan": "Deployment plan for this cycle: allocate ~15% of available USDT (~$1,500) across BTC and ADA, with BTC as the primary focus due to relatively lower RSI and proximity to key macro/technical support zones. Execute via limit ladder (BTC at -2% and -3%; ADA at -2%). Open orders capped at 3 per asset (we have BTC-2, BTC-3, ADA-1). If fills occur, reassess remaining USDT; if none fill within 48 hours, reevaluate prices or cancel and wait for a clearer dip. Next cycle: re-evaluate BTC/ADA momentum, monitor macro data (US employment data, volatility catalysts) and adjust entry points accordingly. Emphasize accumulation over holding; no profit-taking or selling unless extreme risk event occurs.",
