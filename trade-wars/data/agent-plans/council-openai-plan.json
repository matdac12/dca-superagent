  "plan": "Plan for next cycle: Maintain HOLD until a clearly favorable accumulation signal emerges for BTC or ADA. If BTC shows a Strong Buy setup (RSI < 30 across multiple 4h candles and price down >20% from its recent high) or ADA shows a Strong/Good Buy setup (RSI dipping toward 30–40 with a healthy pullback and stabilizing price near support), deploy up to 30–50% of available USDT with a bias to the asset presenting deeper oversold signals and stronger confirmation. Use laddered limit entries at 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% below current price, up to 3 orders per asset, ensuring each order meets the $10 minimum size. If signals are weaker (Normal Accumulation: RSI 40–50 with neutral price action), consider deploying a smaller tranche (10–20%) only when price action confirms support and the book shows solid building bids. Always cancel stale orders after 48 hours and reassess. Primary prioritization note: BTC is the more actionable oversold candidate if a dip or capitulation appears; ADA can be pursued if its RSI cools and price shows healthy pullback with solid bid support. No open orders today; maintain readiness to deploy in a controlled, patient manner.",
