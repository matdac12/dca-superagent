  "plan": "Hold current USDT and stay patient. Reassess in the next 4-hour cycle. If BTC shows RSI dipping into 30-40 and price tests major support (or price drops ~2-4% with evidence of support building), deploy 15-30% of USDT, prioritizing BTC; if ADA shows a comparable Good/Normal accumulation setup (RSI 30-50 with price near support), consider a split entry (BTC/ADA) rather than BTC alone. Use limit orders 2-5% below market (max 3 per asset); cancel or adjust stale orders after 48 hours. If a Strong Buy emerges (RSI < 30 for multiple 4h candles and price down >20% from recent high), deploy 30-50% of USDT with BTC bias or a BTC-heavy split as dictated by signal strength.",
