  "plan": "Execution plan update: Prioritize ADA accumulation in this cycle via a laddered 3-order buy setup at 2%, 3%, and 5% below the current ADAUSDT price (~0.5825). Deploy roughly 15% of USDT to ADA (~$1,500) across the three orders (874 ADA at 0.5719, 885 ADA at 0.5650, 904 ADA at 0.5534). This aligns with a Normal Accumulation stance given ADA's RSI around 63 and recent 24h gain, while staying prudent amid macro volatility (US employment data upcoming). BTC exposure remains via existing limit orders; no new BTC buys today to avoid chasing in a volatile regime. Maintain substantial dry powder (rest of USDT) for future dips or opportunities. Monitor ADA fills over the next 48 hours and reassess; if some orders fill, consider similar scaled entries in subsequent cycles. If macro data triggers a sustained risk-off move, consider rebalancing or delaying further entries until conditions normalize.",
