  "plan": "Current stance: HOLD with zero deployment of USDT. Rationale: neither BTC nor ADA shows a Strong/Good/Normal accumulation signal at this moment. BTC RSI 43.14 (neutral) and ADA RSI 64.54 (slightly elevated) amid mixed price action (BTC ~102.48k, ADA ~$0.5858). Market backdrop includes upcoming US macro data, implying potential volatility; avoid impulsive buys during uncertain conditions. Priority if entry materializes: BTC is marginally more favorable due to closer proximity to support and relatively lower RSI, but wait for clearer pullback signals. Next intended deployment framework (only if signals fire): - Deploy 10-20% of available USDT for Normal Accumulation if BTC/RSI falls into 40-50 range with price testing lower band and support; - If stronger conditions (Good/Strong Buy) emerge for BTC or ADA, scale up to 15-30% (Good) or 30-50% (Strong) of USDT. Execution plan would use LIMIT orders at 2-5% below current market price, up to 3 limit bids per asset, and no more than 6 total open limit orders. If entry triggers, allocate across BTC and ADA based on which asset shows clearer oversold/exit points and better relative entry price. Continuous monitoring cadence remains every 4 hours; reassess if price action closes above key resistance or if RSI breaches extreme levels. ",
