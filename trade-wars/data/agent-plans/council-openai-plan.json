  "plan": "Strategic plan for the next cycle: hold 100% of available USDT for now (no new limit or market buys). Prioritize BTC entries only if a clear favorable setup emerges, then ADA if a separate favorable setup appears. Conditions to trigger deployment (for BTC first, then ADA if available):\n- Strong Buy Opportunity (deploy 30-50% of available USDT): RSI < 30 for multiple 4h candles, price down >20% from recent high, capitulation volume spike, extreme fear in news. Not present now.\n- Good Buy Opportunity (deploy 15-30% of available USDT): RSI 30-40 with price touching/near lower Bollinger Band, healthy pullback in an uptrend, order book showing building support. Not present now.\n- Normal Accumulation (deploy 10-20% of available USDT): RSI 40-50, price range-bound with no recent pump (>10% in 24h), steady accumulation signals. BTC currently sits at RSI ~42.9, which could be considered a Normal Accumulation entry if a follow-through confirmation appears (e.g., continued consolidation near current levels with increasing bid support).\n\nAction plan if signals emerge:\n- BTC: If Normal Accumulation criteria are met (RSI ~40-50 and on-chain/volume supports accumulation) deploy 10-20% of USDT via up to 3 limit orders (2%, 3%, 4% or 2%, 3%, 5% below market price) to ladder in gradually. Prioritize BTC given macro risk and the current depth near $102k with visible bid support around $102,436–$102,443.\n- ADA: Only begin accumulation on a separate favorable signal (RSI moving toward 40-50, price testing lower band with confirming bids, and order book showing support). If triggered, deploy 10-20% of remaining USDT via limited, staged entries (same 2-5% below-market ladder).\n\nOngoing management:\n- Maintain up to 3 open limit orders per asset (BTC/ADA). If conditions do not materialize within 48 hours for any open or pending entries, reassess and potentially cancel or adjust entries.\n- If any entry triggers, update positions to reflect the new allocation and monitor for risk controls (no selling unless extreme risk events).\n- Continue watching macro drivers (US employment data, macro sentiment) as inducements for volatility and potential breakouts or pullbacks.\n\nNext intended cycle focus: Monitor BTC around the $110k resistance and the $102k support zone for potential confirmation signals; monitor ADA for RSI reversion and order-book support shifts. The plan remains intentionally patient to avoid impulsive buys and align with the long-term accumulation objective.",
